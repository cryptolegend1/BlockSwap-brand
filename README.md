# BlockSwap Front-End

---

This is the simple NFT dashboard.
It gets all ticker(NFT)s from subgraph API by using graphQL. There are 3 tabs (Battle Space is disabled for now).
Every NFT has received bid count, the highest bid price, end blocknumber, the address of winner.
It gets nft ID from nft name by calling `lowerTickerToTokenId()` method and also gets image URI by calling `tokenURI()` method.

- `Show All`: This tab shows all NFTs on the network
- `My Tickers`: This tab show only the NFTs that are created by the user account.
